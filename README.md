An exploration of image segmentation using deep learning techniques. 
Image segmentation is a crucial computer vision task that involves dividing an image into segments or pixels with the aim of simplifying its representation or making it more meaningful and easier to analyze. 
The main objective will be to apply and experiment with a pre-trained deep learning model for the purpose of segmenting images into their constituent parts or objects. I chose VGG UNET model based on its accuracy.
